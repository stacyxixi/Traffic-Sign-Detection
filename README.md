## Final Project: Enhanced Road Sign Detection

### Description

The code takes an image under the directory “databases/input” and returns a dictionary with road sign names and locations. 
It also marks the region of the detected sign(s) by drawing a bounding rectangle with a text label, and output images to the directory “database/output”.

### Requirements

The input images are contained within the directory “databases/input”. 
Because the size limit of submitting to canvas, only a small subset of input images were uploaded. 
The  whole set of the input images can be downloaded from the following link:

## Instructions

Run the driver program “TrafficSignDetection.py” to process images and output images with marked road signs. 
Detection functions are included in “DetectionMethod.py” for no challenge,“DetectionMethodWeather” for difficult weather conditions and “DetectionMethodDark” for adverse lightning conditions.
